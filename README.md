# GL-Engine
A simple OpenGL Engine implemented with GLFW, Glad, GLM, and Assimp.

This started a learning exercise to try and gain a better understanding of OpenGL implementation with GLFW. 
I've been interested in 3D graphics and game programming since I was young so I wanted to learn how to go about creating a simple game engine from scratch.
Hopefully, this project will continue to grow and can become something to use as a portfolio piece in the future.
